will_sign
=========

Create time-based HMAC hashes from URLs.

USAGE
=====

  # not really Rails-specific, works with POROs
  class FooController < ApplicationController
    include WillSign
  
  protected
    def sign_secret
      :monkey # this should be something unique and special.
    end

  public
    def index
      url  = "/foo/bar"
      hash = sign_url(url)
      redirect_to "#{url}?token=#{hash}"
    end

    def show
      url  = request.request_uri.split("?").first # "/foo/bar"
      hash = params[:token]
      if signed_url?(url, hash)
        ...
      else
        raise "Token expired"
      end
    end
  end

The default expiry for urls is 300 seconds (5 minutes).  You can set a custom
expiry like this:

  sign_url("foo/bar", 120) # 2 minutes

Or...

  WillSign.default_expiry = 180
  sign_url("foo/bar") # 3 minutes
